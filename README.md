    <h1>Pen Testing With Machine Learning</h1>

   <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This repository contains resources and code examples for using machine learning techniques in penetration testing (pen testing) activities. Penetration testing is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity, aimed at identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications to improve their security posture.</p>

   <p>Integrating machine learning into pen testing processes can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of identifying potential vulnerabilities, automating certain tasks, and improving the overall security assessment process.</p>

  <h2>Contents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scripts:</strong> This directory contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks showcasing various machine learning techniques applied to pen testing scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Datasets:</strong> Sample datasets for training and testing machine learning models in penetration testing contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Detailed documentation on methodologies, algorithms, and best practices for pen testing with machine learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Additional resources such as research papers, articles, and tutorials related to machine learning in penetration testing.</li>
    </ul>
